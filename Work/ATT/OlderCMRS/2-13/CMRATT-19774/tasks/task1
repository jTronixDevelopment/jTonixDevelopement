*Task #1: Create new / update existing page markers*

  Create page markers / CGs for the following URLs below. For any URL that already
  has an existing page marker, you can use the ones below to overwrite
  (*note: If renaming a page marker will impact data pass, let me know.
  The client wants to keep data pass BAU).

  *Wildcard the end of each URL string to ensure that the page is captured accordingly.*

  ADD ALL PAGE MARKERS TO - BCS-Premier-POS
