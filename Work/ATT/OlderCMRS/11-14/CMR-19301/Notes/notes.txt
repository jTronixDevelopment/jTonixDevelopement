Laura McGraw-Morris(7:23:40 AM): Morning team! Just to recap our separate discussions this morning, the test environment is still experiencing issues. I was able to get in once, but then not a second time
Laura McGraw-Morris(7:23:52 AM): I believe Jyoti knows the status of a system reboot
Brandy Edwards(7:24:19 AM): @Laura - Thanks for the update!
Laura McGraw-Morris(7:26:35 AM): Brandy, what this means is we haven't had a stable enough environment to determine if any defects have been fixed by Nuance
Laura McGraw-Morris(7:27:04 AM): we have a testing meeting in 35 mins and have one with Nuance this afternoon to level-set on the existing issues
Brandy Edwards(7:27:23 AM): Please forward me the invite.

Jyoti Mahajan(12:01:14 PM): Hi Ryan
Jyoti Mahajan(12:01:20 PM): the env has not changed
Jyoti Mahajan(12:01:24 PM): its still tst01
Jyoti Mahajan(12:01:33 PM): Nicole updated it incorrectly
Jyoti Mahajan(12:01:46 PM): she meant it for a different JIRA
Ryan Johnson(12:47:22 PM): Okay that sounds good. I am on the call now to find a solution for this ticket.
Laura McGraw-Morris(12:48:09 PM): Thanks so much for the update Ryan!
Brandy Edwards(1:51:51 PM): @Ryan - Any update?
Ryan Johnson(2:02:44 PM): Still on the call now working, to fin what the issue is.
Jyoti Mahajan(2:06:10 PM): Ryan - tst01 env is working now
2:08:13 PM - Laura McGraw-Morris has left the meeting
Ryan Johnson(2:15:02 PM): Ok awesome
Jyoti Mahajan(2:15:20 PM): I am raising another defect Ryan
2:22:09 PM - Brandy Edwards has left the meeting
Ryan Johnson(2:30:12 PM): Okay what is this defect for.
Jyoti Mahajan(2:30:22 PM): the page attribute.eligible Services is not passed on to AGent COnsole if i Initiate chat from Equipment page after i have added offer to Cart..
Jyoti Mahajan(2:30:54 PM): I dont initiate chat on the offers page , rather navigate to Equipment page and then initiate it
Ryan Johnson(2:58:11 PM): So it is looking like this is a timing issue because of the tst01 environments
Jyoti Mahajan(2:58:48 PM): timing issue?
Ryan Johnson(3:00:25 PM): So the way our framework does data pass, is the same on every AT&T page.
Ryan Johnson(3:01:21 PM): So this is not working because when the Nuance framework iterates through the events list, the DS_Bundle_Offers_list is not present.
Ryan Johnson(3:01:36 PM): Although it is present in the Data Layer
Jyoti Mahajan(3:03:11 PM): and when we do page refresh/reload - it still doesnt find it? that should not be case as we get it on all other AT&T pages
Jyoti Mahajan(3:03:53 PM): you are currently only talking about the event variable right, not the page attribute
Ryan Johnson(3:04:59 PM): The page attribute will show on offer-list page, but the DS_Bundle_Offers_list event will not show because the event is not present in the array that we use to pass the Datapass to the agent console.
Jyoti Mahajan(3:05:32 PM): Ryan
Jyoti Mahajan(3:05:35 PM): 2 issues here
Ryan Johnson(3:05:54 PM): What is the 2 issues
Ryan Johnson(3:07:26 PM): ?
Jyoti Mahajan(3:07:28 PM): page attribute should come without page refresh or reload as soon as user initiates Chat with Agent - doesnt happen without page refresh and according to discussion with Laura it should not depend on page refresh, its a page level attribute, it should pass as soon as Chat is initiated as a data pass variable
Jyoti Mahajan(3:07:51 PM): i am really not sure how is that a timing issue
Jyoti Mahajan(3:09:23 PM): 2nd issue - DS_Bundle_Offers_list may not pass initially due to timing but when we refresh the page it should be passed and displayed to AGent , this is how we are getting this on other AT& Pages in test environment
Jyoti Mahajan(3:09:50 PM): if you need i can send you screenshots of other AT&T pages where we are looking for offers attributes
Ryan Johnson(3:13:43 PM): I do not need screen shots I understand what you are saying. What I am trying to say is that: the events are not getting triggered because nuance's frame work has not actually fully loaded when the the events are being emited by AT&T  
Jyoti Mahajan(3:14:14 PM): Ryan - page attribute variable is not linked to the events at all
Jyoti Mahajan(3:15:23 PM): that is why I mentioned there are 2 issues on the offers page
3:17:31 PM -  Park Mermel (TOUCHCOMMERCE, INC) has joined the meeting
Ryan Johnson(3:17:42 PM): Hello Park
Park Mermel(3:18:51 PM): Hello, one minute please to read through the history
Ryan Johnson(3:19:57 PM): Jyoti I have invited Park to better explain what the issue is.
Park Mermel(3:25:27 PM): Hi Jyoti for the page attribute issue, we should be able to pass that on agent assigned Ryan is double checking that now
Jyoti Mahajan(3:28:34 PM): Yeah Park - that should be passed without us having to refresh the page, it is only coming when we refresh that page though - whether we initiate chat from Offers page or from Equipment page
Park Mermel(3:29:48 PM): However, the issue we saw with DS_Bundle_Offers_list is that we are not seeing that event exist at the time when we are checking. For these events there is two ways we can recieve them. One is if they are sent directly to us when the chat framework is loaded on the page. However, if an event is pushed to the ddo prior to our framework being active the events object is queried "ddo.getVar('events')" immediately after we load and the missed events are grabbed from there. However, in this case there seems to be a strange delay at the point when the event "DS_Bundle_Offers_list" is added to the ddo.getVar('events') object, which is causing it to not be available when we check for it.
Park Mermel(3:32:42 PM): so for this event what we are seeing is that it triggers prior to us having loaded on the page and even though the event has already triggered it is not added to that events object until later
Park Mermel(3:32:57 PM): causing us to miss our opportunity to grab the event and it's data
Park Mermel(3:33:18 PM): this is also how we pull events for every other page from the ddo
Park Mermel(3:33:53 PM): so it seems to be that there is something unique to this page / event that is causing a slight delay
Jyoti Mahajan(3:35:02 PM): i understand about event timing - shouldnt page reload get the event code to pass on offers page though as it does on other tst01 offer pages for DTV n other products? or is something else you are observing for this standalone IDP flow?
Park Mermel(3:36:13 PM): it's something completely unique to this page, where the event data isn't available during the opportunities we have to access it.
Park Mermel(3:36:55 PM): if the event was populated in the events obj at the same time it was displaying in the ddo.dumpList() then we would be able to pick it up correctly
Jyoti Mahajan(3:47:53 PM): ohh
